# [Spotify Connect for Ubuntu, Debian and Raspbian (SpoCon)](https://spocon.github.io/spocon)
## Introduction

SpoCon is a [Spotify Connect](https://www.spotify.com/connect/) for
[Debian package and associated repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_\(file_format\))
which thinly wraps the awesome
[librespot-java](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot-java) library by
[Gianluca Altomani](https://github.com/devgianlu) and others. It works out of the box on
all three revisions of the Pi, immediately after installation.

## Download Latest Version

### SpoCon releases for Ubuntu and Debian on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/~spocon/+archive/ubuntu/spocon)
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:spocon/spocon
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get install spocon 
```

### Raspbian releases 

Luckily Launchpad is also supporting armhf versions , these are especially build for distributions like Raspberian 

### Easy Installation

This command downloads and installs the Debian package and adds its apt repository, which ensures you'll always be up to date with upstream changes.
```
curl -sL https://spocon.github.io/spocon/install.sh | sh
```
That's it! Plug a speaker into your Pi on your local network, select the device in Spotify et voilÃ !

### Hard installation

Essentially, here's what the easy installer does,
```
# Install curl and https apt transport
sudo apt-get -y install curl apt-transport-https

# Add repo and its GPG key
curl -sSL https://spocon.github.io/spocon/key.asc | sudo apt-key add -v -
## This downloads the armhf version for Raspbian Pi
echo 'deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/spocon/spocon/ubuntu bionic main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/spocon.list

# Install package
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install spocon
```
### Requirements

You'll need a [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/premium/) account in order
to use Connect.

### Uninstalling

To uninstall, remove the package,

```bash
sudo apt-get remove -y spocon
```

To completely remove spocon and its Debian repository from your system try,
```bash
sudo apt-get remove -y --purge spocon
```

## Configuration


SpoCon should work out of the box and should be discoverable by Spotify Connect on
your local network, however you can configure it by editing `/opt/spocon/config.toml`
which passes arguments to [librespot-java](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot-java).

```toml
deviceName = "librespot-java" ### Device name ###
deviceType = "Computer" ### Device type (Computer, Tablet, Smartphone, Speaker, TV, AVR, STB, AudioDongle, Unknown) ###

[auth] ### Authentication ###
strategy = "ZEROCONF" # Strategy (USER_PASS, ZEROCONF, BLOB, FACEBOOK)
username = "" # Spotify username (BLOB, USER_PASS only)
password = "" # Spotify password (USER_PASS only)
blob = "" # Spotify authentication blob (BLOB only)

[zeroconf] ### Zeroconf ###
listenPort = -1 # Listen on this port (`-1` for random)
listenAll = true # Listen on all interfaces (overrides `zeroconf.interfaces`)
interfaces = "" # Listen on these interfaces (comma separated list of names)

[cache] ### Cache ###
enabled = true # Cache enabled
dir = "./cache/"
doCleanUp = true

[preload] ### Preload ###
enabled = true # Preload enabled

[player] ### Player ###
autoplayEnabled = true # Autoplay similar songs when your music ends
preferredAudioQuality = "VORBIS_160" # Preferred audio quality (VORBIS_96, VORBIS_160, VORBIS_320)
normalisationPregain = 0 # Normalisation pregain
initialVolume = 65536 # Initial volume (0-65536)
logAvailableMixers = true # Log available mixers
mixerSearchKeywords = "" # Mixer/backend search keywords
enableLoadingState = true # Enable loading state (useful for slow connections)

[player.tracks]
useCdn = true # Use CDN to download tracks

[player.episodes]
useCdn = true # Use CDN to download episodes
```

After editing restart the daemon by running: `sudo systemctl restart spocon`

## Building the Package Yourself

### Requirements

- Vagrant installed ( https://www.vagrantup.com/ )
- Virtualbox installed ( https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads )


```bash
cd Vagrant
vagrant up # start your environment
vagrant ssh # login into you environment
cd workspace
ansible-playbook Ansible/start.yml -e librespot_version=0.5.2 -e spocon_version=0.14.0
```

There should be a built Debian package (a `.deb` file) in your project directory /package.


## Troubleshooting

> *My volume on Spotify is 100% and it's still too quiet!*

Have you tried turning the volume up using the command `alsamixer`?

> *My Raspberry Pi does not use my USB sound card!*

Try to replace the following in the file `/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf`:

```
defaults.ctl.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
```
with
```
defaults.ctl.card 1
defaults.pcm.card 1
```
> *The audio output buzzes a few seconds after audio stops!*

This is likely to be ALSA's Dynamic Audio Power Management (DAPM) shutting down
the sound module of your device to save power. If you want to disable this feature,
create a file called `snd_soc_core.conf` in `/etc/modprobe.d` with this line in:
```
options snd_soc_core pmdown_time -1
```
Once you reboot and play some sound, the issue should be gone.

> *Other issues*

File an issue and if we get it sorted, I'll add to this list.

## Donations

(I'd rather you donate to [librespot-java](https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot-java)
instead, but there's no public address for those folks.)
